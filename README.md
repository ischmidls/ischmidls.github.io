# Closing Remarks

These features do not include enough importance to warrant inclusion in the actual site:

- [CATEGORY THEORY IN CONTEXT, Emily Riehl, 2016](https://math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/context.pdf) made available by Riehl

- [NOTES ON TOPOSES AND LOCAL SET THEORIES, JOHN L. BELL, 1992: Revised 2020](https://publish.uwo.ca/~jbell/topnotes.pdf) made available by Bell

 - Here's a  *d e l i g h t f u l*  preprint ["Sets in homotopy type theory" by Egbert Rijke & Bas Spitters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.3835) marries topos with homotopy types.


- See [A MATHEMATICIAN'S APOLOGY by G. H. Hardy](http://www.arvindguptatoys.com/arvindgupta/mathsapology-hardy.pdf). Otherwise, this comedic effort *a la* internet comes to mind quite often:
