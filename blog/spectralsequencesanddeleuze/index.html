<h1 id="stokes-theorem">Stokes’ Theorem</h1>
<p>Let’s step back to a note I made on Stokes’ Theorem.</p>
<p>While Grant Sanderson gives intuitive explanations of each of these
theorems in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrcCbdWwCBc&amp;list=PLSQl0a2vh4HC5feHa6Rc5c0wbRTx56nF7&amp;pp=iAQB">Multivariable
Calculus</a> series on YouTube, I thank Prof. Rick Presman for his
exposition of the <a href="https://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2012/REUPapers/Presman.pdf">Generalized
Stokes’ Theorem</a>, and also Prof. Oliver Knill for his exposition via
<a href="https://people.math.harvard.edu/~knill/teaching/summer2020/handouts/lecture25.pdf">Calculus
in four dimensions</a>.<br>
And, Aleph Naught’s videos: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lGM5DEdMaw">Stokes’ Theorem on
Manifolds</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ptFnIj71SM">The derivative isn’t
what you think it is</a> give intuition as to the Generalized Stokes’
Theorem and perhaps differential geometry more broadly.<br>
—</p>

<p>Here is the gist of Prof. Knill’s exposition on generalized integration and, in turn, Stokes’ Theorem.<br> 
    Note: Prof. Knill does not discuss chains, as this is made for students of multivariable calculus.<br> 
    First, the ladder from 1-d to 4-d.<br> 
    In two dimensions, we see: the line integral<br> 
    \[
    \int_a^b F(r(t)) r'(t) \, dt
    \]
    </p> 
    
    <p>and the double integral<br> 
    \[
    \iint_G f(u,v) \, du \, dv
    \]
    </p> 
    
    <p>In three dimensions, in addition to the line integral, we have the flux integral 
    \[
    \iint_G F(r(u,v)) (r_u \times r_v) \, du \, dv
    \] 
    and the triple integral 
    \[
    \iiint_G f(u,v,w) \, du \, dv \, dw.
    \]
    To express these integrals using differential forms, we can consider forms with one component for simplicity, but it is straightforward to extend to sums by linearity.<br> 
    I cannot make Prof. Knill’s exposition and notation here more concise:</p> 
    
    <p>For a 1-form \( F = A \, dx \), we integrate 
    \[
    \int_a^b A(r(u)) x'(u) \, du.
    \]
    </p> 
    
    <p>For a 2-form \( F = A \, dx \wedge dy \), we integrate 
    \[
    \iint_G A(r(u,v)) \det \begin{bmatrix} r_{u1} & r_{v1} \\ r_{u2} & r_{v2} \end{bmatrix} \, du \, dv.
    \]
    </p> 
    
    <p>For a 3-form \( F = A \, dx \wedge dy \wedge dz \), we integrate 
    \[
    \iiint_G A(r(u,v,w)) \det \begin{bmatrix} r_{u1} & r_{v1} & r_{w1} \\ r_{u2} & r_{v2} & r_{w2} \\ r_{u3} & r_{v3} & r_{w3} \end{bmatrix} \, du \, dv \, dw.
    \]
    </p> 
    
    <p>This determinant is the triple scalar product of the three column vectors. So, we can still work in principle without having seen any linear algebra course.<br> 
    For example, for \( F = B \, dy \), we would compute the line integral as 
    \[
    \int_a^b B(r(u)) y'(u) \, du.
    \]
    </p> 
    
    <p>And for \( F = A \, dx \wedge dz \wedge dt \), we would compute the hyper flux as 
    \[
    \iiint_G A(r(u,v,w)) \det \begin{bmatrix} r_{u1} & r_{v1} & r_{w1} \\ r_{u3} & r_{v3} & r_{w3} \\ r_{u4} & r_{v4} & r_{w4} \end{bmatrix} \, du \, dv \, dw.
    \]
    </p> 
    
    <p>A \( k \)-form \( F \) assigns, to each point \( x \), a \( k \)-linear anti-symmetric map. It can be represented as \( F_x(v_1, \dots, v_k) \), which yields a number. The maps \( v_j \mapsto F_x(v_1, \dots, v_k) \) are linear, and for any pair \( i, j \), we have 
    \[
    F_x(v_1, \dots, v_i, v_j, \dots, v_k) = -F_x(v_1, \dots, v_j, v_i, \dots, v_k).
    \]
    </p> 
    
    <p>Let \( r: G \to \mathbb{R}^4 \) be a parametrization, where \( G \) is a \( k \)-dimensional region mapped into \( \mathbb{R}^4 \). We can assign to each point \( x = r(u) \) the number \( F_x \, du = F_x(r_{u1}, \dots, r_{uk}) \). The flux of the \( k \)-form through the \( k \)-surface \( r(G) \) is then defined as 
    \[
    \int_G F r_u \, du.
    \]
    </p> 
    
    <p>A 1-form \( F = A \, dx \), gives a line integral 
    \[
    \int_a^b F(r(t)) r'(t) \, dt.
    \]
    </p> 
    
    <p>A 2-form \( F = A \, dx \wedge dy \), gives a flux integral 
    \[
    \iint_G F(r(u,v)) (r_u \times r_v) \, du \, dv.
    \]
    </p> 
    
    <p>A 3-form \( F = A \, dx \wedge dy \wedge dt \), gives a hyper flux integral 
    \[
    \iiint_G F(r(u,v,w)) (r_u \times r_v \times r_w) \, du \, dv \, dw.
    \]
    </p> 
    
    <p>A 4-form \( F = A \, dx \wedge dy \wedge dz \wedge dt \), gives a volume integral 
    \[
    \iint\iint_G F(x,y,z,t) \, dx \, dy \, dz \, dt.
    \]
    </p> 
    
    <p>Now, 4-d to k-d. In four dimensions, we have four integral theorems:</p> 
    
    <p>The fundamental theorem of line integrals:
    \[
    \int_a^b d f(r(t)) \cdot r'(t) \, dt = f(r(b)) - f(r(a)).
    \]
    </p> 
    
    <p>Stokes’ theorem for a region \( G \) with boundary \( C \):
    \[
    \iint_G dF(r(u,v)) (r_u \times r_v) \, du \, dv = \oint_C F(r(u)) \cdot r_u \, du.
    \]
    </p> 
    
    <p>The hyper Stokes’ theorem:
    \[
    \iiint_G dF(r(u,v,w)) (r_u \times r_v \times r_w) \, du \, dv \, dw = \iint_G F(r(u,v)) (r_u \times r_v) \, du \, dv.
    \]
    </p> 
    
    <p>The divergence theorem:
    \[
    \iint\iint_G dF(x,y,z,t) \, dx \, dy \, dz \, dt = \iiint_G F(r(u,v,w)) (r_u \times r_v \times r_w) \, du \, dv \, dw.
    \]
    </p> 
    
    <p>All these integral theorems fall under:
    \[
    \int_G dF = \int_{\partial G} F,
    \]
    where \( F \) is a \( k \)-form and \( G \) is a \( k-1 \)-dimensional surface.<br> 
    The 4-dimensional framework extends to higher dimensions with more variables and larger determinant matrices. Confusion arises in 2 and 3 dimensions due to the identification of different spaces, attempting to fuse ideas that 4-d shows to be distinct.</p>

    <hr>
    <p>The overall exterior derivative is a matrix:</p>
    <p><span class="math display">\[ d = k=0 df_k. \]</span></p>
    <p>For example, the Dirac operator is:</p>
    <p><span class="math display">\[ D = d + d^*, \]</span></p>
    <p>and the Laplacian is:</p>
    <p><span class="math display">\[ L = D^2 = d^* d + d d^*. \]</span></p>
    <hr>
    <p>That is a summary of the clearest exposition of the generalized
    Stokes’ Theorem I have found. I recommend reading Prof. Knill’s article
    linked above. He also briefly relates PDEs, which Prof. Steve Brunton
    explains well in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5R-Tm8cV8&amp;list=PLMrJAkhIeNNQromC4WswpU1krLOq5Ro6S&amp;pp=iAQB">YouTube
    Series</a>.</p>

    nLab and Wikipedia do not provide sufficient expositions or problem
    sets?). Even after <a href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/content/blog/exact-sequence-picturebook/PuzzlingThroughExactSequences.pdf">Puzzling
    Through Exact Sequences</a> by Ravi Vakil, I do not understand spectral
    sequences. <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~hutching/teach/215b-2011/ss.pdf">Introduction
    to Spectral Sequences</a> by Michael Hutchings did not quite get me
    there either.</p>
    <p>I understand that they explicate what derived categories implicate. I
    also understand that a filtration (one topological generalization of a
    limit from calculus) of chain complexes constructs a spectral sequence.
    At this point, spectral sequences:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>“are usually constructed from filtrations of cochain complexes”</li>
    <li>Stokes’ theorem generalizes to chain complexes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now, I will defer to nLab’s <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/simplicial+homology">Simplicial
    Homology</a> for a connection between simplicial homology and chain
    complexes, as the other expositions I found do not explicitly state
    this:</p>
    <p>For a simplicial set ( S ) and an abelian group ( A ), the simplicial
    homology of ( S ) is the chain homology of the chain complex
    corresponding, under the Dold-Kan correspondence, to the simplicial
    abelian group of ( A )-chains on ( S ): formal linear combinations of
    simplices in ( S ) with coefficients in ( A ).</p>
    <p>Beyond these tenuous connections, as I learned from Stack Exchange’s
    very own user316092:</p>
    <p><em>“A Basic Course in Algebraic Topology”</em> by Massey contains an
    excellent introduction/motivation to homology by relating it to
    Stokes’/Green’s Theorem (Ch. VI, Section 3, pp. 149–156).</p>
    <p>Now, user316092 is not wrong, but who would have thought that such an
    exposition relies on a better understanding of Algebraic Topology than
    is offered in Reuben Stern’s 14-page handout: <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/rastern/files/algtoppreview.pdf">An
    Introduction to Algebraic Topology</a> for the Harvard Math 101
    class?</p>

    <p>Now, all I have to do is name-drop the De Rham theorem, which relates
    the cohomology of De Rham’s complex to the singular complex, as Massey
    illustrates via Appendix A, proving injectivity via Stokes’ Theorem.</p>
    <p><strong>(Note from Izak 1 year later)</strong><br>
    I can now claim to understand simplicial homology and chain complexes a
    little better after giving my talk on Khovanov homology for a knot
    theory writing course.</p>
    <p>With that brief look at <strong>complexes</strong> and
    <strong>Stokes’ theorem</strong>, I have just enough leeway to relate
    <strong>Deleuze</strong> and <strong>Simplicial Complexes</strong>,
    despite my understanding of neither being deep enough.</p>
    <h1 id="spectral-sequences-now">Spectral Sequences (Now)</h1>
    <p>Speaking of Khovanov homology, the <strong>chain complex</strong> is
    the sequence of (bigraded) vector spaces formed from the smoothings (one
    basis element for each crossing), with differential maps between each
    pair of vector spaces.</p>
    <p>A <strong>vector space</strong> is just a place where scaling
    (multiplying by a scalar) and sliding (adding vectors) is preserved.</p>
    <p>A <strong>differential map</strong> simply takes a function and
    outputs the ratio of that function’s output to its input—commonly called
    the rate of change.</p>
    <p>In this case, vector spaces are the <strong>chains</strong> in the
    complex. It’s clearer with the example we’ll see later.</p>

<p>Homology is (a group describing) how much of the remaining vector
space looks like its kernel.</p>
<p>For those familiar with linear algebra, the image of each
differential is the kernel of the next, so we quotient the kernel by the
image.</p>
<p>Quotient here is just like typical division. For example, when we
quotient sets of 12 items into sets of 4 items, we find three such
4-item subsets. Now, we consider more than just size.</p>
<p>Specifically, we quotient the elements of each ( n )-th vector
space’s kernel by the image of the map into that vector space from the
previous or ((n-1))-th vector space:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ H_n = \frac{\ker d_n}{\text{im}
d_{n-1}}. \]</span></p>
<p>In fact, the equivalence classes (sets of similar-looking cycles)
form a (free Abelian) group, where cycle addition gives class addition.
This is the <strong>homology group</strong>.</p>
<p>We call the elements in the kernel <strong>cycles</strong> and those
in the image <strong>boundaries</strong>, where every boundary is the
differential of some cycle from the preceding vector space.</p>
<p>Simplicial (and even more so, singular) homology defines this via
graphs made of triangles, pyramids (or simplices), and their
higher-dimensional counterparts.</p>
<p>Then, ( n )-simplices are cycles, and by sequentially removing
((n-1))-simplices, we check which ( n )-simplices are boundaries (i.e.,
which cycles annihilate with the next differential).</p>
<p>So, asking <em>“how much of the vector space looks like its
kernel?”</em> is equivalent to asking <em>“how many cycles look like
boundaries?”</em></p>
<p>If you recall <strong>Stokes’ Theorem</strong> from vector calculus,
it also applies to chains. In other words, the duality between
differentials and vectors indicates how we can interpret our vector
spaces using this geometric language.</p>
<p>For a smooth function on a manifold, integrating the ((n-1))-form
over the boundary of the ( n )-form is exactly the same as integrating
the differential of the ((n-1))-form over the ( n )-form:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \int_{\partial \Omega} \omega =
\int_{\Omega} d\omega. \]</span></p>
<p>Now, if you have two chain complexes, you can form (linear) maps from
each vector space in one complex to each in the other.</p>
<p>If there are two distinct mappings, this creates what’s called a
<strong>homotopy</strong>. The maps can “continuously” deform into one
another.</p>
<p>This induces a homotopy map from an ( n )-chain in one complex to the
((n-1))-chain in the other complex.</p>
<p>It commutes with both the differential maps between the vector spaces
and the homology maps.</p>
<p>This “shift down” is simply seeing that:</p>
<ul>
<li>A homotopy between two lines (1-chains) is a square.</li>
<li>A homotopy between two triangles (2-chains) is a triangular
prism.</li>
<li>A homotopy between two pyramids is made of 4-simplices, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two chain-homotopic maps ( f ) and ( g ) act the same on the homology
groups because:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ (f - g) \text{ sends cycles to
boundaries and boundaries to zero.} \]</span></p>
<p>So, if there are distinct maps between chain complexes, then there
are homotopy maps from each chain to the preceding chain in the other
complex.</p>
<p>In the case of <strong>Khovanov homology</strong>, we actually see
<strong>higher-dimensional chain complexes</strong>, that is, complexes
in the category of complexes, etc.</p>
<p>The <strong>Khovanov chains</strong> sum together (via direct sum)
those vector spaces with the same bases relative to the all-positive
state.</p>
<p>Then, the differential maps between chains are given by (total
derivatives of) the differential maps between vector spaces.</p>
<p>Now that I have gotten that out of the way, as this is recreational,
I will get to Deleuze’s <em>Logic of Sense</em>.</p>

<h1 id="deleuze-and-simplicial-homology">Deleuze and Simplicial
Homology</h1>
<p>In “Logic of Sense,” Deleuze focuses on the structure and genesis of
sense, contrasting the insights of Frege and Russell with their
limitations. He argues that while they recognized the condition of truth
lies in sense, they failed to investigate its genesis. Deleuze addresses
this problem by examining the paradoxes arising from the structure of
sense and proposing a theory of its genesis, drawing from analytic
philosophy, Stoicism, and Lewis Carroll’s works. He analyzes three types
of relations within propositions: designation, manifestation, and
signification. These relations can be taken as primary in different
domains of speech, language, and logic. However, Deleuze highlights the
circularity within the theory of the proposition, where each condition
is conditioned by what it supposedly conditions. To overcome this, he
introduces a fourth dimension of propositions, termed expression or
sense. Sense represents what is expressed in a proposition, allowing for
multiple expressions of the same denotatum. In simplicial homology, the
structure and genesis of sense can be related to the construction of
chains and cycles within a simplicial complex. The boundary maps encode
the connections and relations between simplices, analogous to the
relations between sense and propositions.</p>
<p>Deleuze’s philosophy of sense looks at this fourth dimension and its
relation to language. He attributes the Stoics with the discovery of
sense as they distinguished it from corporeal mixtures and recognized
its distinct reality. Sense exists within propositions, yet it is not
identical to them; it subsists or insists as its own objectity. It is
attributed to states of affairs but cannot be confused with them or
their qualities. The structure of sense gives rise to paradoxes,
including the regress of indefinite proliferation and the sterile
reiteration or doubling. Extracted from propositions, sense becomes a
pure ideational event, irreducible to the dimensions of propositions:
states of affairs, mental activities, and universals. Deleuze’s logic of
sense aims to reconcile the sterility of sense in relation to
propositions with its generative power in relation to the dimensions of
propositions. The second half of “Logic of Sense” considers the dynamic
genesis of language, drawing from developmental psychology and
psychoanalysis, highlighting the role of separating sounds from bodies
and organizing them into propositions for expressive purposes. The
existence of sense within propositions and its distinct reality can be
compared to the existence of chains within the chain complex. Sense,
like chains, has its own identity and properties that are separate from
the individual simplices or states of affairs.</p>
<p>Deleuze outlines the dynamic genesis of language, comprising three
stages that correspond to three dimensions: (1) the primary order of
pure noise in the newborn infant’s experience; (2) the secondary
organization, where the surface dimension of sense emerges through the
extraction and synthesis of differential elements; and (3) the tertiary
arrangement found in fully-formed propositions with denotation,
manifestation, and signification functions. The primary order,
resembling a “weatherscape” of intensities, is the initial encounter
with language and constitutes a type of nonsense. Through the secondary
organization, the child extracts phonemes and constructs series in
connective, conjunctive, and disjunctive syntheses. These constructions,
though not yet fully formed units of language, go beyond bodily noises.
Sense serves as the condition or ground of propositions, generating both
their dimensions and their objective correlates. However, the domain of
sense is inherently fragile and can slip into nonsense. Deleuze
distinguishes two types of nonsense, emphasizing the determinate
relation between sense and nonsense and their production from elements
lacking inherent sense. The dynamic genesis of language in Deleuze’s
work can be connected to the process of constructing chain complexes in
simplicial homology. The primary order of pure noise can be seen as the
initial simplices or simplicial complexes, the secondary organization
corresponds to the construction of chains through boundary maps, and the
tertiary arrangement relates to the fully-formed chain complexes with
well-defined boundaries.</p>
<p>Deleuze distinguishes between two types of nonsense: surface nonsense
exemplified by Lewis Carroll’s wordplay and nonsensical phrases, and
profound nonsense found in Antonin Artaud’s writings, where propositions
collapse onto the body. Carroll’s nonsense operates at the surface of
sense, utilizing non-signifying elements to construct linguistic
playfulness. Deleuze identifies the conditions for sense production in
Carroll’s work: extracting differential elements, organizing them in
series, and the paradoxical element that connects the series. However,
the primary order of profound nonsense, seen in Artaud’s schizophrenia,
breaks down the distinction between sonorous language and the physical
body. The distinction between surface nonsense and profound nonsense can
be paralleled with the notion of simplicial homology classes. Surface
nonsense, similar to boundary cycles, exhibits playful and
non-signifying elements within the simplicial complex. Profound
nonsense, like nontrivial homology classes, represents deeper and more
complex relationships that blur the boundaries between language and the
underlying structure.</p>
<p>Deleuze’s collaboration with Guattari will further develop the
concept of the body-without-organs, expanding into a naturalistic
philosophy of “desiring-production” encompassing nature, history, and
politics. While Logic of Sense engages with the linguistic turn in
philosophy, Deleuze ultimately embraces his materialist and naturalistic
inclinations. The collaboration between Deleuze and Guattari, expanding
into a naturalistic philosophy of “desiring-production,” can be related
to the broader applications of simplicial homology beyond individual
spaces. Just as simplicial homology can be applied to study nature,
history, and politics in a larger context, Deleuze and Guattari’s
philosophy extends beyond language and discusses the connections between
various fields of study.</p>
