<p>Pre-script</p>
<p>A friend asked me to explain an old essay of mine, and I realized I
couldn’t. So, here’s my attempt. I’ll try to minimize rambling and
pedantics, respecting your time and focus as a reader.</p>
<p>Note: analytic and synthetic have different meanings in metaphysics,
math, and philosophy of math. Within these disciplines, major figures
(Aristotle, Euclid, Proclus, Kant, Carnap, Frege, etc) defined the terms
in different ways. These differences are perhaps uninteresting to
well-practiced philosophy students. It is the common deflation of
philosophy as mere arguments on “semantics” rather than “matters of
consequence”.</p>
<h1 id="conversation-kant-aristotle-toward-topoi">Conversation: Kant
&amp; Aristotle Toward Topoi</h1>
<p>MAR 30, 2024 (JUN 22, 2023)</p>
<p>The aim of this conversation is to relate Kant and Aristotle’s
ethics. That aim failed. The main focus was logical formalization
through so-called homotopy type theory (HoTT) with categorical
semantics. I end up talking very little about either Kant or Aristotle
and only glaze HoTT and category theory.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Of course, if you’re familiar, skip this.</p>
<p>I recommend Leon Horsten’s overview of philosophy of mathematics from
Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.</p>
<p>First, see some preliminary definitions. Kant, Aristotle,
metaphysics, and ethics can hold their popular understandings. But,
philosophy of math is more niche.</p>
<p>The distinct schools of philosophy of math were largely identified
and labeled at the turn of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>Logicism and formalism are two schools. Logicism holds that mat
reduces to logic. Formalism holds that math is the manipulation of
(written) symbols (like numbers, letters, and other characters on a
piece of paper).</p>
<p>Frege pioneered work at the beginning of this distinction but is more
logicist, disagreeing with much of Hilbert’s project, which is more
formalist.</p>
<p>Another school is intuitionism, which holds that math is cognitive or
psychological. It largely traces back to Brouwer alongside his
instructor and formalized, Heyting. The famous Husserl, and his students
Heiddegger and Carnap all opposed psychologism.</p>
<p>The most popular school among working mathematicians is realism or
platonism, which holds that math “exists” in some way, often independent
of material existence. While Godel’s work is somewhat in the line of
Frege, Russell, who are mostly logicist, Godel had his own unique take
on mathematical realism.</p>
<p>The most popular defenses of realism today argue math is real as far
as it is indispensable to natural science, like physics or
chemistry.</p>
<p>In practice, people pick and choose from these schools or rarely
adhere to only one.</p>
<p>Constructive mathematics is a practice in math that uses direct proof
or “construction”. Intuitionism in some sense gave birth to this
practice, though arguably even Euclid and Archimedes who far predate
Brouwer used constructive arguments.</p>
<p>I argue these schools are vaguely helpful in introducing the history
of the philosophy of math. But, they break down outside the period from
roughly the mid 1800s to mid 1900s.</p>
<h2 id="syntax-semantics">Syntax &amp; Semantics</h2>
<p>A nice explanation of this is in the paper “Categorical Semantics for
Type Theories” by Jason Z.S. Hu at McGill University. The following is
largely based on sections 1 and 3 of this paper. Section 2 is on
principles of category theory.</p>
<p>There are also notions in section 3 I do not touch on such as
computation as monads and logic as adjoint functors. An informal
explanation of the latter (beyond me) would benefit any discussion of
topoi. Sections 4 and 5 cover lambda calculus and categorical semantics
for dependent types respectively. This latter section is especially
relevant but outside my scope or understanding.</p>
<p>Category semantics involves methods that define the meanings of types
and programs within category theory. Despite its relatively short
history compared to other mathematical theories, category theory has
been actively developed since its inception. Category theory serves as a
comprehensive "library" of mathematics, with each category acting as a
general "module" characterizing various mathematical properties.</p>
<p>In categorical semantics, we apply a type system to a specific
category, allowing many properties of the type system to correspond
directly to those of the category. Additionally, connections to other
type systems arise from observing the structures of the categories in
which they reside. Category theory provides a unified platform for
studying type theory, making categorical semantics a more systematic and
modular approach compared to individually examining each feature in an
ad hoc manner.</p>
<p>One pivotal principle in type theory is the Propositions as Types or
Curry-Howard Isomorphism. This principle links two previously distinct
fields: logic and types. In logic, people focus on reasoning and
conclusions, while types emerge in computer science, carrying the
concept of computation. Remarkably, both areas are closely intertwined:
a program can represent a logical argument, and logical operations have
meaningful counterparts in program execution.</p>
<p>The origins of this principle can be traced back to the 1930s. Curry
developed combinatory logic, a logical system that eliminates the need
for quantifying variables and serves as a model of computation. However,
the idea of using terms to represent logical proofs was independently
discovered by intuitionists Brouwer, Heyting, and Kolmogorov,
collectively known as the BHK interpretation.</p>
<p>Gentzen introduced natural deduction, which describes how logical
connectives are constructed and used. This framework has become a
standard formulation in programming language research.</p>
<p>Later, Lambek extended the principle with category theory, showing a
correspondence between simply typed λ-calculus and cartesian closed
categories. This revelation, combined with the connection to logic,
forms the Curry-Howard-Lambek Isomorphism, highlighting the intriguing
interconnection among three seemingly disparate fields.</p>
<p>Understanding or designing a type system typically involves two
approaches: the syntactic point of view and the semantic point of
view.</p>
<p>Syntactic approaches, rooted in logic and proof theory, focus on the
syntactic structures of a type system. They study properties like
subject reduction and cut elimination by directly examining the syntax.
While syntactic approaches are more straightforward and lend themselves
to algorithmic implementation, they lack utilization of the type
system's meanings, making certain properties like normalization
challenging to address.</p>
<p>Semantic approaches, on the other hand, rely on mathematical models
to discuss type systems, providing a broader range of structures beyond
syntax. For example, Giarrusso et al. developed a complex dependent type
system with subtyping using step-indexed logical relations, a semantic
method. However, semantic approaches require a deeper understanding of
concepts and establishing relationships between syntax and semantic
models.</p>
<p>One classical semantic approach is algebraic logic, where logical
systems are modeled by algebraic theories like Boolean algebra and
Heyting algebra. Unlike algebraic logic, category theory offers more
generality, allowing for reasoning about morphisms between objects and
switching structures using functors. This flexibility allows modeling
various concepts in computer science.</p>
<h2 id="hott-formalization-of-kant">HoTT Formalization of Kant</h2>
<p>Homotopy type theory (HoTT) uses type syntax and category semantics
to translate between logical systems (HoTT 11). By embracing
set-theoretic, propositional, and topological paradigms, HoTT offers a
constructive approach to logic (HoTT 9). This allows systematic
comparison of theories based on their unique relations to a shared core,
avoiding reduction to a common representation (HoTT 12, Caramello). HoTT
bridges diverse metaphysical logics via topoi for pluralities of logical
semantics and types for syntactic formalization. Martin-Lof's a
dependent type theory adjacent to HoTT, is influenced by Kant's ideas,
and incorporates categorical semantics (Achourioti and van Lambalgen 16,
31).</p>
<p>Dependent type theory distinguishes between analytic judgments,
interpreting general judgments, and synthetic judgments, interpreting
existential judgments (Martin-Lof, 94). For example, the statement "a:A"
signifies an analytic judgment asserting that the object "a" belongs to
type "A," thus implying the existence of type "A" (Martin-Lof, 91). This
notion aligns with Kantian synthetic judgment, where the existence, and
consequently, the traditional formulation of mathematical logic, is
grounded on an analytic type judgment (Martin-Lof, 94). Note that the
Kantian synthetic here is equivalent to the type-theoretic analytic.
Martin-Lof summarizes this relationship by stating that looking at
mathematical theorems necessitates constructing proofs.</p>
<h2 id="formal-kant-to-ethics">Formal Kant to Ethics</h2>
<p>Shabel argues that Kant's depiction of symbolic construction goes
beyond mere symbolization, suggesting it involves intuitive
representation. Further, Shabel claims that the final step of symbolic
construction requires intuitive representation. And, algebraists
demonstrate intuitive procedures involving the manipulation of
magnitudes, reflecting both inner sense and conceptual relations. In
contrast, Kant proposes that manipulating algebraic formulas directly
reveals how algebraic concepts apply to our inner sense, leading to
synthetic a priori knowledge of magnitude relations based on given
magnitudes. Kant compares symbolic construction to ostensive
construction, emphasizing their achievements in division (Smith).
Shabel's distinguishes Euclid and Kant but ignores the possibility of
synthetic a priori knowledge through symbolic construction within
dependent type theory. Thus, Shabel misses insights into intuitive
procedures and understanding geometric and algebraic concepts.</p>
<p>Similarly, Hanna argues that Kant's propositional logic includes
non-uniform existential commitments, primitive modalities, and intricate
conceptual structures, closely resembling intensional logic (Hanna, §3).
However, Hanna also overlooks parallels with dependent type theory,
which is another intentional logic.</p>
<h2 id="cantor-zfc">Cantor &amp; ZFC</h2>
<p>In favor of separating “mathematized philosophy”, that is philosophy
using mathematical formalisms and logic, from “philosophy of
mathematics”, which is philosophy asking questions of mathematics, I
want to lay out some notes on how mathematical Platonism differs from
what little there is for Plato’s philosophy of math. But, this requires
some history.</p>
<p>Cantor's introduction of set theory led to the rise of modern
mathematical Platonism, despite initial resistance. However, unchecked
Platonism led to paradoxes like Russell's paradox. To address this
Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (ZFC) resolves many
paradoxes. ZFC defines sets within a cumulative hierarchy and allows for
multiple models, including the Continuum Hypothesis. This enables
mathematicians to work with different ZFC models without major
consequences for their research. Cantor's pioneering sets, prompting a
period of mathematical platonism, was later supported by Gödel's work in
set theory, viewing paradoxes as tests for logic and knowledge rather
than direct challenges to mathematics.</p>
<p>Cantor's introduction of set theory spurred modern mathematical
Platonism, initially met with resistance but gaining popularity by the
early 1890s (Gurevich 2). However, unchecked set-theoretic Platonism led
to paradoxes like Russell's paradox (Gurevich 3). Recognizing the
necessity for a clearer grasp of sets while retaining faith in the
theories, Cantor and others pioneered Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with
the axiom of choice ("ZFC"). ZFC resolved numerous paradoxes, defining
sets within a cumulative hierarchy and allowing for multiple models,
including the Continuum Hypothesis, which addresses cardinalities of
sets. This permits mathematicians to engage with different ZFC models
without significant ramifications for their research (Gurevich 5).</p>
<p>Cantor's conviction in sets' independent existence endures, backed by
Gödel's defense of Cantor's set theory, which sees paradoxes as tests
for logic and knowledge rather than mathematics directly (Gurevich 5).
Consequently, the philosophical and mathematical applications of
Platonism diverge, despite frequent allusions to Plato and Aristotle in
discussions linking mathematics and philosophy. Do similar issues arise
in using Kantian ideas in topos theory?</p>
<h2 id="badiou-topoi">Badiou &amp; Topoi</h2>
<p>This is where a more informal explanation of “logic as adjoint
functors” would come in handy.</p>
<p>Alain Badiou engages with Grothendieck's work on topoi but stops
short of fully developing it. He views topoi as a descriptive
alternative to the axiomatic nature of sets, which delineate an infinite
universe of multiples. Sets facilitate discourse about the universe of
thought by establishing conditions through a general concept of
relation, allowing for the localization of a situation of Being. Rather
than a mathematics of Being, topoi look at potential universes and their
rules, reminiscent of Leibniz's idea of universes in God's
Understanding. They elucidate the plurality of possible logics,
showcasing the variability of appearances while upholding the necessary
univocity of Being-multiple. This includes classical topoi that uphold
principles like the excluded middle, as well as non-classical logics
that do not adhere to these principles. Badiou's analysis focuses
specifically on the logical interpretation of topoi, which differs from
Grothendieck's ontological perspective.</p>
<p>Badiou uses topoi in logic to bridge the gap between mathematics and
logic (Plotnitsky 358, Badiou Being 119). He contrasts two perspectives:
a Platonist one, aligning mathematics with the ontology of the
multiple-without-One, where mathematics is seen as a foundational
ontology of thought based on axioms; and an Aristotelian perspective,
which views mathematics more linguistically, reducing it to a grammar or
logic of possibilities, as seen in Russell and Frege (Plotnitsky 359,
Badiou Being 102). While many modern approaches to mathematical logic
lean towards this mathematically Aristotelian view, Badiou acknowledges
exceptions such as Gödel, who take a Platonist stance (Plotnitsky 359,
Badiou Being 92). Badiou argues that this Aristotelian perspective fails
to treat mathematics as thought, instead treating it as a formal game
governed by predefined rules. Mathematics transforms into an aesthetic
pursuit, detached from understanding real existence, but crafting a
coherent fiction guided by its own clear-cut rules (Plotnitsky 359,
Badiou Being 48).</p>
<p>Badiou's stance distinguishes between mathematical and philosophical
Platonism: he's philosophically Platonist but mathematically
Aristotelian. Conversely, a Kantian approach aligns more with
mathematical Aristotelianism, suggesting that topoi should serve as
ontology instead of merely logic, as proposed by Badiou. In turn,
Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) further suggests that mathematical objects
can be seen as types, and proofs as paths between these types, rather
than isolated abstract entities.</p>
<h2 id="mathematizing-aristotle">Mathematizing Aristotle</h2>
<p>Similar to Kant's blending of metaphysics and transcendental logic,
the Aristotelian perspective, whether mathematical or philosophical,
must consider both ethics and metaphysics. Aristotle's argument in
Nicomachean Ethics (Bk 10. Ch 6-8) shows the unrivaled nature of genuine
eudaimonia, rooted in a common foundation of practical and theoretical
wisdom within eudaimonia itself (Cohen and Reed §14).</p>
<p>Anagnostopoulos suggests that Aristotle both acknowledges and rejects
the idea of ethics being precise. At the same time, scholars like
Broadie, Annas, and Hutchinson look into Aristotle's views on friendship
and justice, but they may overlook the precise relationship between
these virtues (Herbenick).</p>
<p>Aristotle categorizes methods as either exact or inexact depending on
the subject matter. He then introduces two models for decision-making:
one for achieving a happy life with institutional justice and another
for achieving it without. These models incorporate both rational
calculation and mathematical tools to address errors and mistakes,
particularly in relation to achieving a happy and just life. While
Aristotle shows the importance of friendship and justice, mathematics
becomes useful when immoderate friendship leads to injustice. This
suggests that in normative ethics, inexactness (such as the concept of
friendship) is generally accepted, while exactness (referring to the
mathematics of moderation) is the exception. Consequently, the
mathematization of ethics needs to be at least partially integrated into
metaethics (Herbenick).</p>
<p>Now, Aristotle’s virtue can be likened to a feedback loop. This means
that practicing virtuous actions influences future virtuous behavior
(Herbenick). Eudaimonia acts as the guiding principle in this ongoing
cycle of virtue. Concepts like recursive types and fixed points in type
theory are relevant to understanding virtue and eudaimonia, enabling
self-reference and setting typing rules (Stump 1-2). Looking at
conaturals, which include transfinite numbers, provides a deeper insight
into the feedback loop of virtue, connecting with Aristotle's
metaphysical concepts of being, non-being, and infinity. Aristotle's
philosophy shows the importance of actuality over potentiality,
highlighting the superiority of what is actual (Cohen and Reed §12).</p>
<p>By using a set-theoretic recursive method, we represent incremental
elements akin to peeling an onion in reverse. Through decategorification
and counting with natural numbers, as suggested by Baez, abstractly
obtaining herd sizes without arranging them in line becomes feasible.
using natural numbers aids in abstracting Aristotelian virtue feedback
loops, especially within the context of topos theory's
category-theoretic and recursive framework. This characterization sets
the stage for a type-theoretic interpretation of Aristotle's ethics. By
initiating with the empty category instead of the empty set, we offer an
ontological interpretation, where the empty category arises from
functorality. Additionally, the rules for constructing types of natural
numbers explicitly express this without depending on category-theoretic
semantics, as discussed by Gangle (98) and in HoTT (432).</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>While Aristotle's and Kant's metaphysics and ethics can be
mathematically formalized, even within HoTT where theories exist as
subspaces in a continuous and composable space, the objective extends
beyond mere formal presentation or justification. Badiou's Logics of
Worlds lacks an explanation for establishing Badiou’s intensities
independently of subject-dependent appearances, as noted by Livingston.
The theory of transcendentals, linked to Heyting algebras and specific
logics, overlooks the assumption that transcendentals are linguistic or
conventional. Going beyond Badiou’s philosophical "mathemes,"
formalizing the logicism of Kant and Aristotle in HoTT would benefit
from enhanced precision and accuracy, aligning with broader HoTT
research objectives.</p>
<p>Kant and Aristotle's metaphysics and ethics may translate into
Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT), where their logical frameworks can interact
across topoi. Kant's transcendental logic finds interpretation through
Martin-Lof's type-theoretic approach to analytic and synthetic
judgments. The philosophical intersections between dependent type theory
and Kant's transcendental logic merit further investigation,
particularly concerning synthetic a priori knowledge. While
mathematicizing Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics faces issues in the
feasibility and relevance of applying mathematics to ethical frameworks.
The development of set theory, notably ZFC, addressed paradoxes but
raised questions about mathematical Platonism. Badiou's utilization of
topoi as a logical framework aims to unify logic and mathematics,
highlighting the diversity of possible logics and the singularity of
Being-multiple. However, Badiou's reliance on set theory to establish
topoi may be unnecessary.</p>
<p>In HoTT, mathematics is grounded differently, avoiding detached
abstractions. Badiou's Platonism and Aristotelianism find resonance with
a Kantian interpretation that integrates ethics and metaphysics through
type theory and category theory. Applying type theory and topos theory
can enhance the formalism of Aristotle's ethics, using natural numbers
and recursive contexts. Mathematizing Aristotle and Kant in HoTT reveals
unobvious connections, but challenges persist. We need further research
in navigating subjective appearances, questioning transcendental
assumptions, and evaluating support for political doctrines and radical
change.</p>

<p>I no longer support this formalization, but I probably would if I had
not put in this work. I’ve removed information on Bentham, Mill, Rusell,
etc.</p>
<p>Arkady Plotnitsky and Simon Duffy gave me hope.</p>
