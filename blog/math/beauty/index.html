    MathOverflow <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/q/49151/502781">discussion</a></p></li>

    is this commutative diagram for continuity?</strong></a></p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Select quotes made aware to me by J.S. Milne’s site:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>Certainly the best times were when I was alone with mathematics,
    free of ambition and pretense, and indifferent to the world. (Langlands,
    <em>Mathematicians: An Outer View of the Inner World</em>, p
    142)</p></li>
    <li><p>Every mathematician worthy of the name has experienced, if only
    rarely, the state of lucid exaltation in which one thought succeeds
    another as if miraculously, and in which the unconscious (however one
    interprets that word) seems to play a role. (André Weil)</p></li>
    <li><p>A mathematician is so rare an animal that he deserves to be
    preserved, be it only on the score of curiosity. (Simone Weil as quoted
    on p.396 of the Pétrement biography)</p></li>
    <li><p>I knew then, sometimes, the fullness of contemplation, when all
    heard sounds contribute to a single vast harmony. But more often, what
    had been brought into the light immediately became the motivation and
    means for a new plunge into the mists, in pursuit of a new incarnation
    of That which remained forever mysterious, unknown, calling me
    constantly. (Grothendieck)</p></li>
    <li><p>The ability to feel the beauty of mathematics is probably the
    most important ability to be a good mathematician. Sense of beauty is of
    course defined very differently between mathematicians. It is important
    that each mathematician have their own way to feel the beauty of
    mathematics. Otherwise we cannot be original. (Kenji Fukaya)</p></li>
    <li><p>Mathematics has been for me, not only a profession, but also my
    preferred hobby. … Again and again I have been guided by a sense of the
    architecture of this edifice, to which we continue to add new wings and
    new floors while renovating the parts already constructed, into feeling
    that certain problems had priority as opening new perspectives or
    establishing a new foundation for future constructions. This is the
    professional point of view, but happily these problems were those that
    attracted me the most. In other instances I was not guided by such
    motives, being attracted only by curiosity, by the need to know the
    answer to an enigma, without reference to its importance in a general
    context. (Borel, Œuvres IV, p 376)</p></li>
    <li><p>It is while doing mathematical research that one truly comes to
    see the beauty of mathematics. It faces you in those moments when the
    underlying simplicity of a question appears and its meaningless
    complications can be forgotten. In those moments a piece of a colossal
    logical structure is illuminated, and some of the meaning hidden in the
    nature of things is finally revealed. (Ruelle, The Mathematician’s
    Brain, p 130)</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Other quotes I’ve encountered:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>Mathematics…possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty—a beauty
    cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of
    our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music,
    yet sublimely pure… (Bertrand Russell,Mysticism and Logic)</p></li>
    <li><p>The difference between the poet and the mathematician is that the
    poet tries to get his head into the heavens while the mathematician
    tries to get the heavens into his head. (G.K. Chesterton,
    orthodoxy)</p></li>
    <li><p>Pure mathematics is, in its way, the poetry of logical ideas. One
    seeks the most general ideas of operation which will bring together in
    simple, logical and unified form the largest possible circle of formal
    relationships. In this effort toward logical beauty spiritual formulas
    are discovered necessary for the deeper penetration into the laws of
    nature. (Albert Einstein, Emmy Noether’s Obituary)</p></li>
    <li><p>When I heard the learn’d astronomer,  When the proofs, the
    figures, were ranged in columns before me,  When I was shown the charts
    and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them,  When I sitting heard
    the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the
    lecture-room, How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,  Till
    rising and gliding out I wander’d off by myself,  In the mystical moist
    night-air, and from time to time,Look’d up in perfect silence at the
    stars. (Walt Whitman)</p></li>
    <li><p>I asked: ‘What does mathematics mean to you?’, and some people
    answered: “The manipulation of numbers, the manipulation of structures.’
    And if I had asked what music means to you, would you have answered:
    ’The manipulation of notes? (Serge Lang, The Beauty of Doing
    Mathematics)</p></li>
    <li><p>Computer science is no more about studying computers than
    astronomy is about studying telescopes. (Edsger Dijkstra)</p></li>
    <li><p>Don’t just read it; fight it! Ask your own questions, look for
    your own examples, discover your own proofs. Is the hypothesis
    necessary? Is the converse true? What happens in the classical special
    case? What about the degenerate cases? Where does the proof use the
    hypothesis? (Paul Halmos, “I want to be a mathematician”)</p></li>
    <li><p>We often hear that mathematics consists mainly of “proving
    theorems.” Is a writer’s job mainly that of “writing sentences?”
    (Gian-Carlo Rota)a</p></li>
    <li><p>“The introduction of the cipher 0 or the group concept was
    general nonsense too, and mathematics was more or less stagnating for
    thousands of years because nobody was around to take such childish
    steps…” (Alexander Grothendieck, writing to Ronald Brown)</p></li>
    <li><p>“It seems to me that the poet has only to perceive that which
    others do not perceive, to look deeper than others look. And the
    mathematician must do the same thing.” - Sofia Kovalevskay</p></li>
    <li><p>“Mathematics requires a small dose, not of genius, but of an
    imaginative freedom which, in a larger dose, would be insanity” - Angus
    K Rodgers</p></li>
    <li><p>Poincaré famously said that ‘mathematics is the art of giving the
    same name to different things.’ (To which a poet quipped: ‘Poetry is the
    art of giving different names to the same thing.’) — Francis Su</p></li>
    <li><p>Mathematics is the science of patterns and the art of engaging
    the meaning of those patterns. — Francis Su</p></li>
    <li><p>“[Algebraic geometry] seems to have acquired the reputation of
    being esoteric, exclusive, and very abstract, with adherents who are
    secretly plotting to take over all the rest of mathematics. In one
    respect this last point is accurate.” David Mumford</p></li>
    <li><p>“The books or the music in which we thought the beauty was
    located will betray us if we trust to them; it was not in them, it only
    came through them, and what came through them was longing. These things
    — the beauty, the memory of our own past — are good images of what we
    really desire; but if they are mistaken for the thing itself they turn
    into dumb idols, breaking the hearts of their worshipers. For they are
    not the thing itself; they are only the scent of a flower we have not
    found, the echo of a tune we have not heard, news from a country we have
    never visited.” C.S. Lewis, The Weight of Glory</p></li>
    <li><p>“What matters to any teacher of mathematics is the teaching of
    what mathematicians in their shoptalk informally refer to as the “truth”
    of a theory, a truth that has to do with the concordance of a statement
    with facts of the world, like the truth of any physical law. In the
    teaching of mathematics, the truth that is demanded by the students and
    provided by the teacher is such a factual/worldly truth, not the formal
    truth that one associates with the game of theorem-proving. A good
    teacher of mathematics is one who knows how to disclose the full light
    of such factual/worldly truth before students, while at the same time
    training them in the skills of carefully recording such truth.”
    Gian-­Carlo Rota, “The Concept of Mathematical Truth,” Review of
    Metaphysics 44, no. 3 (1991)</p></li>
    <li><p>“Every time that a human being succeeds in making an effort of
    attention with the sole idea of increasing his grasp of truth, he
    acquires a greater aptitude for grasping it, even if his effort produces
    no visible fruit.” Simone Weil “Reflections on the Right Use of School
    Studies…” (1942)</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="post-script-on-the-little-prince">Post-script on <em>The Little
    Prince</em></h2>
    <ul>
    <li><p>“A rock pile ceases to be a rock pile the moment a single man
    contemplates it, bearing within him the image of a cathedral” Antoine de
    Saint Exupèry, The Little Prince</p></li>
    <li><p>“‘What makes the desert beautiful,’ said the Little Prince, ‘is
    that somewhere it hides a well’” Antoine de Saint Exupèry, The Little

    <li><p>“‘It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your
