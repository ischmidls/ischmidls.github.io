      <h2 id="intro" title="intro">intro</h2>
      <p>Hi, my name is Izak. I am a math student at <a title="OSU" href="https://math.oregonstate.edu">OSU</a> with some experience in programming & tutoring.</p>
      <p>I am broadly interested in Homotopy, Types, & Topoi. But, namely <em>"'what makes the desert beautiful,′ said the little prince, ‘is that somewhere it hides a well'"</em> ... my cryptic (perhaps romantic) way of saying, math is difficult in different ways for everyone. It is work. But, we can hope that each person holds some unique <em>well</em> for which the rigors of math have some beauty.</em></p>
      <p>In Stayton, Oregon, I grew up with plenty of grass fields & forests. It is beautiful. But, more importantly, I grew up with many supportive, genuine people.</p>
      <p>Growing up, I also enjoyed scouts, theater, science fairs, & miscelaneous activities.</p>
      <p>Reading & learning occupy my efforts & my imagination more than I could wish for. It is even better when I can share these things.</p>
      <p>There's info about how I've made this site &mdash; alongside more nonsense like this "intro" &mdash; all on the <a href="/about/">about</a> page, including some mysterious links.</p>
