      <h2 id="intro" title="intro">intro</h2>
      <p>Hi, my name is Izak. I am a math undergraduate with some experience in programming & tutoring.</p>
      <p>I am broadly interested in Homotopy, Types, & Topoi. But, at the end of the day, <blockquote>'what makes the desert beautiful,' said the little prince, 'is that somewhere it hides a well'</blockquote>
      which is my cryptic (& perhaps starry-eyed) way of saying something boring: math is difficult (but also nice) in different ways for everyone. It is work.</p>
      {# <p>In Stayton, Oregon, I grew up with plenty of grass fields & forests. It is beautiful. But, more importantly, I grew up with many supportive, genuine people.</p>
      
      <p>Reading & learning occupy my efforts & my imagination more than I could wish for. It is even better when I can share these things.</p> #}
      <p>Ok, enough soap box for today: there's info about this site &mdash; & more nonsense like this "intro" &mdash; all on the <a href="/about/">about</a> page, including some fun links.</p>
      <h2 id="work" title="projects">projects</h2>
      <p>I keep some projects on a Google Site for flexibility. You can view it here: 
        <a title="projects" href="https://sites.google.com/view/ischmidls/home">projects</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Below are <em>posts</em> ranging from javascript widgets to 80-minute reads.</p>
