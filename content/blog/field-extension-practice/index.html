  <h4>(1) Lecture Exercise for Reader</h4>
<p>To show that <span class="math inline">\(F / \{0\} \cong F\)</span>,
    we need to establish an isomorphism between the quotient ring <span
    class="math inline">\(F / \{0\}\)</span> and the field <span
    class="math inline">\(F\)</span>.</p>
    <p>Let <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> be a field. <span
    class="math inline">\(\{0\}\)</span> is the zero ideal in <span
    class="math inline">\(F\)</span>.</p>
    <p>The quotient ring <span class="math inline">\(F / \{0\}\)</span> is
    constructed by partitioning <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> into
    cosets of the ideal <span class="math inline">\(\{0\}\)</span>. Since
    <span class="math inline">\(\{0\}\)</span> contains only the zero
    element, every element <span class="math inline">\(a \in F\)</span>
    forms a distinct coset <span class="math inline">\(a +
    \{0\}\)</span>.</p>
    <p>Each coset <span class="math inline">\(a + \{0\}\)</span> is simply
    <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. Hence, the set of cosets is just
    the set of elements of <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>.</p>
    <p>The addition and multiplication operations on the cosets are defined
    as follows: <span class="math display">\[(a + \{0\}) + (b + \{0\}) = (a
    + b) + \{0\}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[(a + \{0\}) \cdot (b
    + \{0\}) = (a \cdot b) + \{0\}\]</span> Since <span
    class="math inline">\(\{0\}\)</span> is the zero ideal, these operations
    reduce to: <span class="math display">\[a + b + \{0\} = a + b\]</span>
    <span class="math display">\[a \cdot b + \{0\} = a \cdot b\]</span></p>
    <p>Define the map <span class="math inline">\(\varphi: F / \{0\} \to
    F\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(\varphi(a + \{0\}) =
    a\)</span>. This map is well-defined because each coset <span
    class="math inline">\(a + \{0\}\)</span> corresponds uniquely to <span
    class="math inline">\(a\)</span>.</p>
    <p>Check that <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span> is a ring
    homomorphism: <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span> is injective:
    If <span class="math inline">\(\varphi(a + \{0\}) = \varphi(b +
    \{0\})\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(a = b\)</span>. <span
    class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span> is surjective: For any <span
    class="math inline">\(a \in F\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(a =
    \varphi(a + \{0\})\)</span>.</p>
    <p>Since <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span> is a bijective
    homomorphism, it is an isomorphism. Therefore, <span
    class="math inline">\(F / \{0\} \cong F\)</span>.</p>
    <p>Thus, we have shown that <span class="math inline">\(F /
    \{0\}\)</span> is isomorphic to <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>.

    <h4>(2) Lecture Exercise for Reader</h4>
    <p>(a) Want to show that <span class="math inline">\(f = x^3 + 2x +
    1\)</span> is irreducible over <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_3\)</span> and that <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_3[x] / I\)</span> is a field of order
    27 containing a subfield isomorphic to <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_3\)</span>. A polynomial of degree 3 is
    irreducible over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_3\)</span> if it
    has no roots in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_3\)</span> and
    cannot be factored into polynomials of lower degrees. To check for
    roots, evaluate <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = x^3 + 2x + 1\)</span>
    at <span class="math inline">\(x = 0, 1, 2\)</span> in <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_3\)</span>. For <span
    class="math inline">\(f(0) = 0^3 + 2 \cdot 0 + 1 = 1\)</span>, <span
    class="math inline">\(f(1) = 1^3 + 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 \equiv
    1 \pmod{3}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(f(2) = 2^3 + 2
    \cdot 2 + 1 = 8 + 4 + 1 = 13 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}\)</span>, none of these
    are zero, so <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> has no roots in
    <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_3\)</span>. Since <span
    class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> has no roots, it cannot be factored
    into a product of a linear polynomial and a quadratic polynomial in
    <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_3[x]\)</span>. Thus, <span
    class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is irreducible over <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_3\)</span>. Since <span
    class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is irreducible, the ideal <span
    class="math inline">\((f)\)</span> is maximal, and the quotient ring
    <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_3[x] / (f)\)</span> is a field.
    The polynomial <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is of degree 3,
    and the quotient ring <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_3[x] /
    (f)\)</span> consists of equivalence classes of polynomials of degree
    less than 3: <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_3[x] / (f) = \{ a +
    bx + cx^2 + (f) \mid a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z}_3 \}\)</span>. There are
    <span class="math inline">\(3^3 = 27\)</span> such equivalence classes,
    so <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_3[x] / (f)\)</span> is a field
    of order 27. The field <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_3\)</span>
    is naturally embedded in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_3[x] /
    (f)\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\{ a + (f) \mid a \in
    \mathbb{Z}_3 \}\)</span>, forming a subfield isomorphic to <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_3\)</span>. <span
    class="math inline">\(\square\)</span></p>
    <p>(b) Want to show that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_3[x] /
    (f)\)</span> is a field extension of <span
    class="math inline">\(\overline{\mathbb{Z}}_3\)</span> and is a
    3-dimensional vector space over <span
    class="math inline">\(\overline{\mathbb{Z}}_3\)</span> with basis <span
    class="math inline">\(\{1 + (f), x + (f), x^2 + (f)\}\)</span>. Let
    <span class="math inline">\(\overline{\mathbb{Z}}_3 = \{ 0 + (f), 1 +
    (f), 2 + (f) \}\)</span>, which is isomorphic to <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_3\)</span>. The field <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_3[x] / (f)\)</span> contains <span
    class="math inline">\(\overline{\mathbb{Z}}_3\)</span> as its subfield,
    making it a field extension. Any element of <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_3[x] / (f)\)</span> can be written as
    <span class="math inline">\(a + bx + cx^2 + (f)\)</span> where <span
    class="math inline">\(a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z}_3\)</span>, and the
    elements <span class="math inline">\(\{1 + (f), x + (f), x^2 +
    (f)\}\)</span> span <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_3[x] /
    (f)\)</span>. To show that <span class="math inline">\(\{1 + (f), x +
    (f), x^2 + (f)\}\)</span> is a basis, we need to establish linear
    independence and spanning. For linear independence, suppose <span
    class="math inline">\(\alpha (1 + (f)) + \beta (x + (f)) + \gamma (x^2 +
    (f)) = 0 + (f)\)</span>, which implies <span
    class="math inline">\(\alpha + \beta x + \gamma x^2 \equiv 0
    \pmod{f}\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(1, x, x^2\)</span>
    are linearly independent in <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_3[x]\)</span> modulo <span
    class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>, it follows that <span
    class="math inline">\(\alpha = \beta = \gamma = 0\)</span>. For
    spanning, any element in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_3[x] /
    (f)\)</span> can be expressed as a linear combination of <span
    class="math inline">\(1, x, x^2\)</span> over <span
    class="math inline">\(\overline{\mathbb{Z}}_3\)</span>. Thus, <span
    class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_3[x] / (f)\)</span> is a 3-dimensional
    vector space over <span
    class="math inline">\(\overline{\mathbb{Z}}_3\)</span> with basis <span
    class="math inline">\(\{1 + (f), x + (f), x^2 + (f)\}\)</span>. <span
    class="math inline">\(\square\)</span></p>
