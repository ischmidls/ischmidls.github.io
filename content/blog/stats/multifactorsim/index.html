    (no interaction) and a <strong>saturated model</strong> (with

    <p>The additive model treats <code>Treatment</code> as a categorical
    variable with 2 degrees of freedom, yielding a sum of squares of 16.62,
    a mean square of 8.31, an F-value of 9.07, and a p-value of 0.015. In
    contrast, the numeric model treats <code>Treatment</code> as a numeric
    variable with 1 degree of freedom, resulting in a larger sum of squares
    (47.15), mean square (47.15), and F-value (56.75), with a highly
    significant p-value (0.0001). Both models show significant effects for
    <code>Block</code>, but the numeric model explains more variation in the
    response variable through the linear effect of <code>Treatment</code>,
    as evidenced by the higher F-value and lower p-value. This suggests that
    modeling <code>Treatment</code> as a numeric variable provides a better
    fit for the data in this case than eliminating interactions.</p>
    <p>Modeling <code>Treatment</code> as a numeric variable will
    <strong>not always provide a better fit</strong> for the data than
    eliminating interactions. Whether this approach improves the fit depends
    on the underlying relationship between the <code>Treatment</code>
    variable and the response. If the true relationship between
    <code>Treatment</code> and the response is <strong>linear</strong>, then
    treating <code>Treatment</code> as numeric can provide a better fit by
    reducing the number of parameters and capturing the trend more
    efficiently. However, if the relationship is <strong>nonlinear</strong>
    or if there are significant interactions between <code>Treatment</code>
    and other factors (e.g., <code>Block</code>), then treating
    <code>Treatment</code> as numeric may oversimplify the model and lead to
    a poorer fit. In such cases, retaining <code>Treatment</code> as a
    categorical variable and eliminating insignificant interactions (if
    justified) might be more appropriate. The choice of model should be
    guided by diagnostic checks, such as residual analysis, lack-of-fit
    tests, and domain knowledge, to ensure the model accurately reflects the
    data structure.</p>
