<p>Hi, I’d like to tell you about Khovanov homology with minimal intense
    algebra and end with an informal example of ribbon concordance. My
    inspiration was a theorem: “ribbon concordance induces an injective map
    on Khovanov homology,” based on the work of Levine and Zemke (2019).</p>
    <p>Homology is about “cycles” or kernels (inputs that map to zero) of
    the differential maps modulo those cycles that are “boundaries” or
    images in sequences of vector spaces. This quotient forms the homology
    as a group.</p>
    <p>The smoothing states of a link diagram form a sequence of vector
    spaces classes a chain complex (vector space = chain, sequence =
    complex) that also have isomorphic homology. The order of the sequence
    is given by differential maps or boundary maps between the vector
    spaces.</p>
    <p>The image of each map is the kernel of the next, until the sequence
    reaches the trivial kernel, which is just zero.</p>
    <p>The homology is the group formed by the quotient of the kernel by
    image. If you don’t know about groups, just think about these for now as
    some vector space without scaling. (If you’re unfamiliar with quotients,
    this is just like quotients with numbers, but instead of saying there
    are 4 things that look like 3 among 12 things, you separate them by
    their vector space properties). You can think of this as saying how much
    of the remaining space looks like the kernel.</p>
    <p>This also has a geometric view. The kernels are cycles, or closed
    loops, for some base point in the vector space. The image is the
    boundaries in the space. We say boundary in the sense that you can
    imagine the vector space basis as a graph, right, with basis vectors as
    vertices?. A boundary is what remains when you remove part of the graph
    that is one dimension less. For example, removing a line from a triangle
    or a face from a pyramid/simplex.</p>
    <p>When you take two chain complexes and can find two distinct maps
    between the complexes that pair up their (homology groups) chains/vector
    spaces the same way, this induces what are called homotopies between the
    chains or vector spaces.</p>
    <p>Recall the Jones and Kauffman polynomials came from defining rules
    for link brackets.</p>
    <p>In thia picture, let <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> be the
    link and <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> be a vector space of
    dimensions <span class="math inline">\((q + q^{-1})\)</span>. The map
    <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> takes a double complex to a
    single complex by taking direct sums along the diagonals of the double
    complex. The differential map <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is
    not yet defined.</p>
    <p>The bracket is given by a direct sum over the smoothings of <span
    class="math inline">\(L\)</span> of tensor powers of <span
    class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, where a factor of the powers of <span
    class="math inline">\(V\)</span> corresponds to a cycle in a smoothing.
    That is, the space <span class="math inline">\(V(k)\)</span> on each
    vertex <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> has as many tensor factors
    as there are cycles in the smoothing <span
    class="math inline">\(S(k)\)</span>. These powers behave like spaces of
    linear combinations of marked smoothings of <span
    class="math inline">\(L\)</span>, so each cycle in a smoothing of <span
    class="math inline">\(L\)</span> corresponds to an element of <span
    class="math inline">\(V\)</span>.</p>
    <p>Khovanov does this similarly, defining his own bracket, with states
    sums and other definitions similar to Khovanov. For the bracket, he
    exploits the fact the Euler characteristic of each chain or vector space
    is the same as the Euler characteristic of the corresponding homology
    group. Here I must make a slight point, Khovanov homology actually
    describes a cohomology, where instead of boundary maps taking away
    components, the maps between chains or vector spaces add components.
    This Euler characteristic of the Khovanov homology also happens to be
    the Jones polynomial we talked about.</p>
    <p>He also uses that the boundary maps are given by the vector space
    gradings, or the fact that we can add smoothing states together to form
    smoothings with fewer components, or as we did with Kauffman, we can add
    more smoothings to a state to achieve more components. The Khovanov
    polynomial similarly uses the dimensions of each cohomology for the
    chain complex of the link states for the corresponding term in the sum
    defining the polynomial.</p>
    <p>A Tensor product in this case is just a way to take any of the basis
    vectors and put them into a list, where the list is a new basis vector
    in the new space, and vice versa, taking lists and breaking them apart.
    You can imagine as the kernel of the vector space shrinks, less of the
    vector space looks like its kernel, and in a sense at the limit of these
    boundary maps, we reach the stalk vector space growing out the kernels
    of the chain complex of vector spaces.</p>
    <p>Now stepping back from the chain complex, we can see it forms a cube.
    And we know this is a chain complex precisely because this cube
    commutes. That is, taking a boundary map in the first row, then mapping
    to the second row should be the same as mapping to the second row then
    taking a boundary map. This also shows that the definitions of the bases
    or the order of smoothings will not change this chain complex for a
    given knot.</p>
    <p>To wrap up quickly, let’s look at some examples. We have this
    illustration from (Bar-Natan, 2002) for the trefoil. You can see how
    moving between the states forms different brackets from their sums, and
    these brackets form a complex.</p>
    <p>You can see boundary maps change the tensor power of the vector space
    and the degree shift. The tensor power does not change the vector space
    dimension, but the degree shift does. While these are integer vector
    spaces, you can think of Euclidean space. If a matrix mapping a vector
    space to another is rectangular, it deletes one of the basis elements,
    and the situation is similar here.</p>
    <p>Concordance or more broadly cobordism can be seen as a map between
    Khovanov homologies and is clearly a homotopy between two links as the
    manifold provides the path mapping. For example, rolling up a sheet of
    paper into a cylinder and slipping a rubber band around each end
    connects two unknotted rubber bands. In 4 dimensions, the cylinder might
    smooth out, untying any knot.</p>
    <p>A “path” is a continuous map from an interval to a space. A
    “homotopy” of paths is a “family of maps” from an interval to a space
    with the same endpoints where paths follow another path. Think of it as
    a map from two intervals to the space. A “composition/product path” lets
    you glue two paths together. As we discussed in class, a “loop” is a
    path that ends and begins at the same point (i.e., the “basepoint”).</p>
    <p>We look at cobordisms or concordance with “movie moves”, looking at
    different 3-dimensional places in the four dimensional manifold where
    there are singularities (max, min saddle).</p>
    <p>And, we could go both directions, given a concordance between two
    links, we can find their Khovanov homologies are the same, or given
    Khovanov homologies between two links, we can find a cobordism between
    the links.</p>
    <p>Khovanov homology also gives combinatorial methods for more abstract
    homologies in other fields like Floer homologies (3-manifold, Heegaard,
    Lagrangian).</p>
    <p>And we will have to end there. Any questions?</p>

    <p>Further Information for potential questions or extra time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ribbon concordance between two knots has no local minima.</li>
        <li>Concordance for two submanifolds \( M' \), \( M'' \) contained in \( N \) is a cobordism between them in \( N \times [0, 1] \), so a manifold with boundary \( W \) contained in \( N \times [0, 1] \) whose boundary is \( M' \times \{0\} \) and \( M'' \times \{1\} \).</li>
        <li>This is a relative form of cobordism since it all happens in \( N \).</li>
        <li>\( I = [0, 1] \). It is a 1-dimensional cobordism between the 0-dimensional manifolds \( \{0\} \), \( \{1\} \).</li>
        <li>Generally, for any closed manifold \( M \), \( (M \times I; M \times \{0\}, M \times \{1\}) \) is a cobordism from \( M \times \{0\} \) to \( M \times \{1\} \).</li>
        <li>A homotopy between two continuous functions \( f \) and \( g \) from a topological space \( X \) to a topological space \( Y \) is defined to be a continuous function \( H: X \times [0, 1] \to Y \) (so from the product of the space with the unit interval \( X \times [0, 1] \) to \( Y \)) such that \( H(x, 0) = f(x) \) and \( H(x, 1) = g(x) \) for all \( x \in X \).</li>
        <li>Two links, denoted as \( l' \) within \( m \)-sphere and \( l'' \) within \( n \)-sphere, are considered concordant if there exists an embedding function \( f \) from \( l' \times [0, 1] \) to \( n \)-sphere \( \times [0, 1] \).</li>
        <li>This function has two conditions:
            <ul>
                <li>The image \( f(l' \times \{0\}) = l' \times \{0\} \).</li>
                <li>The image \( f(l' \times \{1\}) = l'' \times \{1\} \).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>This forms an equivalence relation.</li>
        <li>It is a weaker condition than isotopy and a stronger condition than homotopy, meaning that:
            <ul>
                <li>Isotopy implies concordance/cobordism (and concordance implies cobordism).</li>
                <li>Concordance/cobordism implies homotopy.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Slice knot concordant with unknot (3D knot bounds disc in 4D).</li>
        <li>\( Kh(L) \): “Poincaré Polynomial” formal power series in one indeterminate, say \( t \), where the coefficient of \( t^n \) gives the dimension (or rank) of the substructure of elements homogeneous of degree \( n \).</li>
