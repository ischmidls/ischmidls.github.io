<p>Here is a proof I struggled with in the spring of 2024 that I wanted
to come back to. To start, this proof gives nice motivation for an
abstract area of math called Galois theory which is most famous for
showing that there’s no “quadratic formula” or closed expression for the
roots of a polynomial of degrees greater than four. But another
interesting motivation is in coding theory, where finite fields and
their polynomials can construct error-correcting codes. For example,
Reed-Solomon codes encode data as polynomials over a finite field <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{F}_{2^m}\)</span>. The proof that
irreducible polynomials divide <span class="math inline">\(x^{p^n} -
x\)</span> ensures that the roots of these polynomials lie within <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{F}_{2^m}\)</span>, making encoding and
decoding efficient. This property allows Reed-Solomon codes to detect
and correct errors in data transmission, such as in CDs or QR codes. By
adding <span class="math inline">\(t = n - k\)</span> check symbols to
the data, Reed-Solomon codes can detect any combination of up to <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> erroneous symbols, or locate and
correct up to <span class="math inline">\(\lfloor t/2 \rfloor\)</span>
erroneous symbols at unknown locations.</p>
<hr />
<p>We want to show every irreducible polynomial <span
class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> over a finite field of prime
characteristic <span class="math inline">\(F_p\)</span> is a divisor of
<span class="math inline">\(x^{p^n}-x\)</span> for some natural number
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<p>First, as a lemma, we’ll show every finite field <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is perfect, meaning every irreducible
polynomial over <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> has no multiple
roots in any field extension over <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span>, or equivalently, every irreducible
polynomial over <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is separable, or
its roots are distinct in an algebraic closure of <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span>, so the number of distinct roots is
equal to the degree of the polynomial.</p>
<p>Say <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is a finite field of
characteristic <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Say <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> maps <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(f(x) =
x^p\)</span> for any <span class="math inline">\(x \in F\)</span>. See
<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a field automorphism as <span
class="math inline">\(f(ab) = (ab)^p = a^p b^p = f(a) f(b)\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(f(a+b) = (a+b)^p = a^p + \binom{p}{1}
a^{p-1} b + \binom{p}{2} a^{p-2}b^2 + \dots + \binom{p}{p-1}ab^{p-1} +
b^p = a^p + b^p\)</span>as <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>
divides <span class="math inline">\(\binom{p}{i}\)</span>. And, <span
class="math inline">\(x \neq 0\)</span> gives <span
class="math inline">\(x^p \neq 0\)</span>, so <span
class="math inline">\(\ker f = \{0\}\)</span>. Then <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is injective and as <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is finite, <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> injective gives <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> surjective. We see then <span
class="math inline">\(F^p = F\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, to show any irreducible polynomial over <span
class="math inline">\(F_p\)</span> divides <span
class="math inline">\(x^{p^n}-x\)</span>, say <span
class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> is an irreducible polynomial of
degree <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{F}_p[x]\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(K\)</span> be the finite extension of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{F}_p\)</span> obtained by adjoining all
the zeros of <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(\overline{\mathbb{F}_p}\)</span>, the algebraic
closure of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{F}_p\)</span>. Then <span
class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is a finite field of order <span
class="math inline">\(p^n\)</span> for some positive integer <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, and consists precisely of all zeros of
<span class="math inline">\(x^{p^n} - x\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(\overline{\mathbb{F}_p}\)</span>. Now <span
class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> factors into linear factors in <span
class="math inline">\(K[x]\)</span>, as the linear factors of <span
class="math inline">\(x^{p^n} - x\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(K[x]\)</span> include these linear factors, and
<span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> has no repeated roots since we
showed every finite field is perfect. Thus, <span
class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> is a divisor of <span
class="math inline">\(x^{p^n} - x\)</span>.</p>
