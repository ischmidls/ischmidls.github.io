<p>Here is a proof I struggled with in the spring of 2024 that I wanted
to come back to. To start, this proof gives nice motivation for an
abstract area of math called Galois theory which is most famous for
showing that there’s no “quadratic formula” or closed expression for the
roots of a polynomial of degrees greater than four. But another
interesting motivation is in coding theory, where finite fields and
their polynomials can construct error-correcting codes. For example,
Reed-Solomon codes encode data as polynomials over a finite field <span
class="math inline">\(F_{2^m}\)</span>. The proof that irreducible
polynomials divide <span class="math inline">\(x^{p^n} - x\)</span>
ensures that the roots of these polynomials lie within <span
class="math inline">\(F_{2^m}\)</span>, making encoding and decoding
efficient. This property allows Reed-Solomon codes to detect and correct
errors in data transmission, such as in CDs or QR codes. By adding <span
class="math inline">\(t = n - k\)</span> check symbols to the data,
Reed-Solomon codes can detect any combination of up to <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> erroneous symbols, or locate and
correct up to <span class="math inline">\(\lfloor t/2 \rfloor\)</span>
erroneous symbols at unknown locations.</p>
<hr />
<p>We want to show every irreducible polynomial <span
class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span> over a finite field of prime
characteristic <span class="math inline">\(F_p\)</span> is a divisor of
<span class="math inline">\(x^{p^n}-x\)</span> for some natural number
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<p>First, as a lemma, we’ll show every finite field <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is perfect, meaning every irreducible
polynomial over <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> has no multiple
roots in any field extension over <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span>, or equivalently, every irreducible
polynomial over <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is separable, or
its roots are distinct in an algebraic closure of <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span>, so the number of distinct roots is
equal to the degree of the polynomial.</p>
<p>Say <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is a finite field of
characteristic <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Say <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> maps <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(f(x) =
x^p\)</span> for any <span class="math inline">\(x \in F\)</span>. See
<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a field automorphism as <span
class="math inline">\(f(ab) = (ab)^p = a^p b^p = f(a) f(b)\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(f(a+b) = (a+b)^p = a^p + \binom{p}{1}
a^{p-1} b + \binom{p}{2} a^{p-2}b^2 + \dots + \binom{p}{p-1}ab^{p-1} +
b^p = a^p + b^p\)</span>as <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>
divides <span class="math inline">\(\binom{p}{i}\)</span>. And, <span
class="math inline">\(x \neq 0\)</span> gives <span
class="math inline">\(x^p \neq 0\)</span>, so <span
class="math inline">\(\ker f = \{0\}\)</span>. Then <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is injective and as <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is finite, <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> injective gives <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> surjective. We see then <span
class="math inline">\(F^p = F\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, to show any irreducible polynomial over <span
class="math inline">\(F_p\)</span> divides <span
class="math inline">\(x^{p^n}-x\)</span>, say <span
class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span> is an irreducible polynomial of
degree <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(F_p[x]\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(K\)</span> be the finite extension of <span
class="math inline">\(F_p\)</span> obtained by adjoining all the zeros
of <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(\overline{F_p}\)</span>, the algebraic closure of
<span class="math inline">\(F_p\)</span>. Then <span
class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is a finite field of order <span
class="math inline">\(p^n\)</span> for some positive integer <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, and consists precisely of all zeros of
<span class="math inline">\(x^{p^n} - x\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(\overline{F_p}\)</span>. Now <span
class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span> factors into linear factors in <span
class="math inline">\(K[x]\)</span>, as the linear factors of <span
class="math inline">\(x^{p^n} - x\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(K[x]\)</span> include these linear factors, and
<span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span> has no repeated roots since we
showed every finite field is perfect. Thus, <span
class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span> is a divisor of <span
class="math inline">\(x^{p^n} - x\)</span>.</p>
<hr />
<p>For example, say <span class="math inline">\(p = 5\)</span>, and
consider the finite field <span class="math inline">\(F_5\)</span>.
Suppose <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span> is an irreducible
polynomial of degree <span class="math inline">\(m = 2\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(F_5[x]\)</span>, such as <span
class="math inline">\(g(x) = x^2 + x + 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>As this is a small finite field, we can check the reducibility
directly.</p>
<p>A polynomial of degree 2 is reducible over <span
class="math inline">\(F_5\)</span> if and only if it has at least one
root in <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1,2,3,4\}\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(0^2 + 0 + 1 = 1 \neq 0
\pmod{5}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(1^2 + 1 + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \neq 0
\pmod{5}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(2^2 + 2 + 1 = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 \equiv 2 \neq
0 \pmod{5}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(3^2 + 3 + 1 = 9 + 3 + 1 = 13 \equiv 3
\neq 0 \pmod{5}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(4^2 + 4 + 1 = 16 + 4 + 1 = 21 \equiv 1
\neq 0 \pmod{5}\)</span></p>
<p>As none of these values satisfy the equation <span
class="math inline">\(x^2 + x + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{5}\)</span>, the
polynomial has no roots in <span class="math inline">\(F_5\)</span>.</p>
<p>Instead, the zeros of <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span> lie
in an extension field <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> of <span
class="math inline">\(F_5\)</span>. Since <span
class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span> is irreducible of degree <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>
is a finite field of order <span class="math inline">\(5^2 =
25\)</span>. To see the roots of <span class="math inline">\(g(x) = x^2
+ x + 1\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(F_{25}\)</span>, we
first recognize that <span class="math inline">\(F_{25}\)</span> is a
field of order <span class="math inline">\(5^2\)</span>, meaning its
elements can be written in the form <span class="math inline">\(a +
by\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(a, b \in F_5\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is a root of an irreducible
quadratic polynomial over <span class="math inline">\(F_5\)</span>.</p>
<p>To see this, say <span class="math inline">\(x_0 = y\)</span> is a
root of <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span>, so <span
class="math inline">\(x_0^2 + x_0 + 1 = 0\)</span>. The polynomial <span
class="math inline">\(g(x) = x^2 + x + 1\)</span> is quadratic, so if
<span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> is one root, the other root
<span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> can be found using the
relationship between the roots and coefficients. For a quadratic
equation <span class="math inline">\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\)</span>, the sum
of the roots is <span class="math inline">\(x_0 + x_1 = -b/a\)</span>,
and the product of the roots is <span class="math inline">\(x_0 x_1 =
c/a\)</span>. Here, <span class="math inline">\(b = 1\)</span>, so <span
class="math inline">\(x_0 + x_1 = -1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(c=1\)</span> so <span class="math inline">\(x_0
x_1 = 1\)</span>. Solving for <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span>,
we get <span class="math inline">\(x_1 = -x_0 - 1\)</span> or $x_1 =
1/x_0 $. So, the other root is explicitly <span
class="math inline">\(-x_0 - 1\)</span>. And, <span
class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span> factors as <span
class="math inline">\(g(x) = (x - x_0)(x - (-x_0 - 1))\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(F_{25}[x]\)</span>.</p>
<p>We can check that their product equals the constant term of <span
class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span>, or <span
class="math inline">\(c=1\)</span>. Multiplying the two roots, <span
class="math inline">\(y(4y + 4) = 4y^2 + 4y\)</span>. Substituting <span
class="math inline">\(y^2 = 4y + 4\)</span>, we get <span
class="math inline">\(4(4y + 4) + 4y = 16y + 16 + 4y\)</span>, which
simplifies to <span class="math inline">\(20y + 16 \equiv 0y + 1 \equiv
1 \mod 5\)</span>. This confirms that <span class="math inline">\(x_0
x_1 = 1\)</span>, as expected.</p>
<p>As the roots <span class="math inline">\(x_0 = y\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(x_1 = 4y + 4\)</span> satisfy <span
class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span>, we can factor the polynomial in
<span class="math inline">\(F_{25}[x]\)</span> as <span
class="math inline">\(g(x) = (x - y)(x - (4y + 4))\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, to see why every element in <span
class="math inline">\(F_{25}\)</span> satisfies <span
class="math inline">\(x^{25} - x = 0\)</span>, see the field <span
class="math inline">\(F_{25}\)</span> has 25 elements as it is an
extension of <span class="math inline">\(F_5\)</span> of degree 2,
meaning <span class="math inline">\(|F_{25}| = 5^2 = 25\)</span>. In any
finite field <span class="math inline">\(F_q\)</span>, every element
satisfies the equation <span class="math inline">\(x^q = x\)</span></p>
<p>which follows from the fact that the field is the splitting field of
<span class="math inline">\(x^q - x\)</span> over its prime
subfield.</p>
<p>To prove this directly, consider the multiplicative group of nonzero
elements in <span class="math inline">\(F_{25}\)</span>, which has order
<span class="math inline">\(25 - 1 = 24\)</span>. This group is cyclic,
meaning every nonzero element <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>
satisfies <span class="math inline">\(x^{24} = 1.\)</span></p>
<p>Multiplying both sides by <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, we
see <span class="math inline">\(x^{25} = x.\)</span></p>
<p>For <span class="math inline">\(x = 0\)</span>, the equation <span
class="math inline">\(0^{25} - 0 = 0\)</span> holds trivially. Hence,
for <strong>every</strong> element <span class="math inline">\(x \in
F_{25}\)</span>, we see that <span class="math inline">\(x^{25} - x =
0.\)</span></p>
<p>So, <span class="math inline">\(x^{25} - x\)</span> is an identity
for all elements in <span class="math inline">\(F_{25}\)</span>, proving
that it holds in the whole field.</p>
<p>So, as every element in <span class="math inline">\(F_{25}\)</span>
satisfies <span class="math inline">\(x^{25} - x = 0\)</span>, the roots
of <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span> must be among the solutions
to this equation. This implies that the linear factors <span
class="math inline">\((x - x_0)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\((x - x_1)\)</span> divide <span
class="math inline">\(x^{25} - x\)</span>, and so, <span
class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span> divides <span
class="math inline">\(x^{25} - x\)</span>.</p>
<p>Thus, <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span> is a divisor of <span
class="math inline">\(x^{25} - x\)</span>.</p>
<p>This shows that <span class="math inline">\(g(x) = x^2 + x +
1\)</span> divides <span class="math inline">\(x^{25} - x\)</span> in
<span class="math inline">\(F_5[x]\)</span>.</p>
