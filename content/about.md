_"All the rings considered in this treatise will have a unit element; all the modules over such a ring will be assumed to be unitary; the ring homomorphisms will always be assumed to send the unit element to the unit element; unless otherwise stated, a subring of a ring A will be assumed to contain the unit element of A. We will focus in particular on commutative rings, and when we speak of a ring without specifying any details, it will be implied that it is commutative. If A is a not-necessarily-commutative ring, by A-module we will we mean a left module unless stated otherwise."_
