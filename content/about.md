"As in many parts of modern mathematics, the first intuition seems further and further away, in appearance, from the correct language needed to express the mathematics in question with complete precision and the desired level of generality. In practice, the psychological difficulty comes from the need to replicate some familiar set-theoretic constructions to a category that is already quite different from that of sets (the category of preschemes, or the category of preschemes over a given prescheme): Cartesian products, group laws, ring laws, module laws, fibre bundles, principal homogeneous fibre bundles, etc. It will most likely be difficult for the mathematician, in the future, to shy away from this new effort of abstraction (maybe rather negligible, on the whole, in comparison with that supplied by our fathers) to familiarize themselves with the theory of sets."

"All the rings considered in this treatise will have a unit element; all the modules over such a ring will be assumed to be unitary; the ring homomorphisms will always be assumed to send the unit element to the unit element; unless otherwise stated, a subring of a ring A will be assumed to contain the unit element of A. We will focus in particular on commutative rings, and when we speak of a ring without specifying any details, it will be implied that it is commutative. If A is a not-necessarily-commutative ring, by A-module we will we mean a left module unless stated otherwise."
